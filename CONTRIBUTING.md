# How to contribute

You need to fork a repository and implement changes inside the forked repo. After that, you can create a PR to the `development` branch.
More info about forking and branching you can find on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

## Before opening a PR

- Make sure that new features are covered by tests.
- Run tests by `pnpm test` command and make sure that they are passing.
- Lint and format code by running `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format`.
- Build package by `pnpm build` and make sure that build is working.
- Test documentation by `pnpm docs:build` and `pnpm docs:test`.

Thank you for considering contributing :)
